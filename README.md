## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project provides the frontend UI for **The Lost Art of Keeping a Secret**, a minimalistic service for secure, ephemeral sharing of sensitive information (e.g. passwords, tokens, certificates) via one-time links.

Secrets are encrypted server-side and deleted either after the first view or after 12 hours â€” whichever comes first.
